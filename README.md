A safe Rust interface for [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/index.php#download). This crate also exposes access to the SCIP's C-API through the `ffi` module. 
The project is currently actively developed, issues/pull-requests are very welcome.

## Installation

By running
```bash
cargo add russcip --features bundled
```

The `bundled` feature will download a precompiled SCIP as part of the build process.
This is the easiest to get started with russcip, instead you could try the [from-source](#from-source-feature) 
or if you want to link against your custom SCIP installation check the [section](#custom-scip-installation) below.

### `from-source` feature
To build SCIP from source, you can enable the `from-source` feature. This will download the SCIP source code and build it as part of the build process. 
```bash
cargo add russcip --features from-source
```

### Custom SCIP installation
If no feature is not enabled, `russcip` will look for a scip installation in the current conda environment,
to install SCIP using conda run the following command
```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge scip
```
Alternatively, you can specify the installation directory through the `SCIPOPTDIR` environment variable.

*russcip* is tested against SCIP 9.0.0 but it might work for other versions depending on which functionality you use. 


### Examples
An [example](examples/create_and_solve.rs) on how to model and solve an integer program can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.
To run the example, you can use the following command
```bash
cargo run --example create_and_solve
```


## The `raw` feature
You can enable this feature by specifying the feature in your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
russcip = { features = ["raw"] }
```
This enables access to the `scip_ptr` unsafe function in the `Model` struct, which gives you access to the underlying SCIP raw pointer. This is can be used in combination with the `ffi` module to call SCIP functions that are not wrapped yet in the safe interface. 

## Implementing Custom Plugins
Some of SCIP's plugins are imported to the rust interface as traits. Currently the implemented plugins are: 

|   **Name**    |                          **File**                          |                                                                                              **Docs**                                                                                              |

To add a custom plugin to a SCIP `Model` instance, you should implement its trait and call the corresponding `include_{PLUGIN_NAME}` method. For examples on implementing the specific plugin trait you can check the tests in the corresponding files.

## About SCIP

SCIP is currently one of the fastest non-commercial solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). It is also a framework for constraint integer programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows for total control of the solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of the solver.
